> Reading. Writing. Communicating. Observing. These are basic activities that fill our days and are the core of our daily work and life. Dedicating time and effort to get better at these skills is the path to stay competitive in any area. Everything else is build on top of these ones, thus they are key to building a strong self.

Reading.
My parents bought 4 different encyclopaedias for me when i was younger. I read everything i could find. Then the internet. suffice to say that I find nearly everything interesting, the stuff that don't pique my interest in the slightest - I find the fans of them fascinating.

Over the years I have at the same time curtail my reading breadth for a little more depth. I am more picky on the sources of information, and the topics I follow.

an example of todays topics that i have read:
- Pandas documentation
- stackoverflow
- Understanding procrastination and how to deal with it
- cycling panniers and trunk bags
- ebikes (sold locally)
- how to create better infographics
- How someone got started in Data Science
- How Great Whites are missing off the Cape (and no one knows why)
- cluster headaches
- Kashmir
- coupla reddit posts

I was kinda busy today so very little reading.

Writing.
I used to lay in bed exhausted but my mind used to race. I used to think up so many things. I had a run-on-lines poem for a couple months. I used to continue from the last line, minimum five lines.
I struggled to actually write down things cos a) there's never a pen when you need one and b) it's past 2 in the morning - can't put on lights and make a noise looking stuff.<br>
I became quite proficient at typing with my 4 to 5 fingers (spread over both hands). but i always wanted to touch as fast as i can speak.<br>
I started last year but got distracted, this year I made it my goal. With that speed increase comes alot of benefits, the least of which will be ease of typing on my computer.
I'll be able to code faster, erase most of the code and start again - iterate faster.<br>
I can jot down my thoughts faster without interrupting the flow. I tend to over analyse and sending text always takes abit longer cos I have to check my tone, _is there a chance i can be misunderstood_, and mispelling in this day and age shows utter lasiness! - i love irony but typing at a slow speed causes me to reread and overwrite my thoughts which greatly hampers the flow. I have become less caring of others approval (not that i really needed it), actually I have become less worried about being misunderstood - I am always willing to clarify or substantiate.

Communication.
Thats what got me into programs such as Dawsons Creek and Gilmore Girls. I was always fascinated with not only how articulate they are, but more so by how aware they are of their feelings and intentions.<br>
I plan to communicate better in my writing (through multiple iterations and less self-censorship) as well as verbally. I such at small talk
