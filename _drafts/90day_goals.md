Plan a 90 day project/goal.

>"Short-term goals can be useful developmental tools if they are balanced within a nurturing long-term philosophy. Too much sheltering from results can be stunting."
> Josh Waitzkin, The Art of Learning

Dan Sulivan has his clients answer these questions every 90 days:
“Winning Achievements? Looking back over the past quarter, what are the things that make you the proudest about what you have achieved?”

“What’s Hot? When you look at everything that’s going on today, which areas of focus and progress are making you the most confident?”

“Bigger and Better? Now, looking ahead at the next quarter, what new things are giving you the greatest sense of excitement?”

“What are the five new ‘jumps’ you can now achieve that will make your next 90 days a great quarter regardless of what else happens?”

take two days to review.
use questions to reflect:
- What went well?
- What were your key wins?
- What did you learn?
- What has you most excited?
- Where do you need to pivot?
