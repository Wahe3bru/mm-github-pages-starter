The rationale is that maybe we can spread the workout throughout the day. I don't have much time to go to the gym, and the free time I have happens when energy levels are low and not convenient (affecting sleep).

But if I can do some simple workouts spread throughout the day, then maybe I will still be able to get similar benefits. So every time I go to the bathroom or kitchen, I do I micro-workout. It's not intense enough to start sweating, but is challenging.

This will be a continous developing project. Hopefully I will be able to develop a habit of a micro-workout every hour. For now it will be every 2 hours (which might be enough) and will list a menu of exercises from which to choose from.

micro-workouts:
- squats: air squat till sitting position
- leg ups: like knee raises, but more running on the spot.
- wall push: push up leaning against a wall
- heel raise: stand on tippy toes to raise heels
- exaggerated knee raises: do a knee raise, then used hands to raise knee higher (3 seconds).
- standing hops: keep "bouncy" hop forward and then back keeping springyness
- single leg balances: balance on slightly bent single leg for 30 seconds.
- foot flexibility exercises:
- - alphabet spelling: spell out each letter with big toe
- - yoga crunch: crunch toes without curling and press foot firmly on the ground.

07:30 alphabet spelling
9:30 10 squats
10:30 10 exaggerated knee raises
12:30 25 wall push
