After reading (this article on note taking and life)[http://www.markwk.com/plain-text-life.html] I have decided to use a similar system.

I plan to use github to save my notes; solving accessibility, storage and versioning.
I already use atom, and it has a good enough search. The only thing I need to standardise is the tag system.

tags:
#books - for book reviews
#thoughts - for lightbulb moments
#notes - smart notes, atomic ideas from readings, summarized in my own words.
#garden - ideas/plans/notes on garden
#home - ideas for improving the house
#study
#hobby
#work
more to add

Since I need to be more organised, I have started tracking my online reading via instapaper and IFTT, which records the articles added and/or liked in gsheets.

I need to add my driving distance log. I need to automate this.

also track expenses, I installed 'Genius scan' to take pic of all my receipts. I also need to develop a system whereby I systematically go through and organise them weekly.
