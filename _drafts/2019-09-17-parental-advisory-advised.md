“Worry not that your child listens to you; worry most that they watch you.” — Ronald A. Heifetz

>You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.
The archer sees the mark upon the path of the infinite, and He bends you with His might that His arrows may go swift and far.
Let your bending in the archer’s hand be for gladness;
For even as He loves the arrow that flies, so He loves also the bow that is stable.

- Khalil Gibran
