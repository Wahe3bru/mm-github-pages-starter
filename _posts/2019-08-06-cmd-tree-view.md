I have gotten used to using git-bash on my work pc as I use bash on both my Mac and Raspi's.

So while writing some instructions/guides whilst I wait for OpenCV to be setup. I came across a cool little trick for command prompt.

I have often seen the folder structure of a project by using the  `tree` command in bash. There are ways to install those type programs in git-bash but googling a solution I cam across this  `cmd //c tree`
