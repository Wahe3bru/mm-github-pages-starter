Monday:<br>
Tuesday: no vasbyt, 4km run and some boxing.<br>
Wednessday: rest day.<br>
Thursday: run to buy coconut milk, while Ruby cycles<br>
Friday:<br>
Saturday: xfit<br>
Sunday: Swim cancelled<br>

This week things are starting to settle down. We are not in our weekly routine yet, but we getting there. Vasbyt has not started yet so we did a short run incorporating some hills.
I did another 4km run to get into the running swing of things.
On Saturday I met a vasbyt buddy and he was wanting to improve his swimming technique in order to train for triathlons. My goal is to do triathlons and decided to join him on weekly sunday swims at the military diving pool. I figure by the end of the year I will have my running down and in between I can have correct swimming technique and start training next year seriously for mini/sprint triathlons.

For now the swimming will be a meditation on learning and kaizen. simarlily to how I am treating the run training, but a bit more relaxed.

I can begin ramping up my work related studying as I consolidate my daily routine.
