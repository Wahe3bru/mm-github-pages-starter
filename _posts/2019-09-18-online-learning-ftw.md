I have always been interested in things, how they work and how they came to be.
Unfortunately, a lot of my interests were not shared with those around me. My parents,
being big on education bought me 4 different encyclopedias by the time I started to read.
They encouraged self learning and searching for the answer instead of asking them. As I got
older I realized that was more to do with them not actually knowing the answer, or knowing how to
explain it in a why I could understand. The world was changing, and South Africa was opening itself up
to the world. Then the internet became accessible and my world opened up. Being a kid of the 90's I was more
technologically adept than most adults which meant that figuring out how things worked and explaining (in a way that they can comprehend) became my job.

I have learned a lot from people both online and IRL.
Most of my online learning came from free offerings or shared experiences  in blogs and forums.
I was super excited for MOOCs, but by then I was finishing my studies and working full time.
During my free time I started taking courses and discovered some quality ones on Udemy.
Then I was given a couple months free access to Datacamp a month before my official deep dive into Data Science. I rapidly went through the Data Scientist for python course that gave me a jump on my programming and understanding. Close to the end of the year EDSA was exploring and trialing Datacamp and gave us a couple months access. I used that opportunity to complete the Data Scientist with R course. Admittedly I need to practice more of my R skills, but Datacamp has a huge selection of R topics.

Datacamp recently had a sale on their annual subscription and I decided to take the offer as they have a lot of interesting courses. I found that to get the best benefits of Datacamp is to already know the basics of a specific language (python or R) and data science, and then jump into the individual topics and practice what you have learned.

### So with my subscription, what will I learn in this year?
Initially I want to master SQL and improve my python abilities. I have made a list on some topics of interest, but they will probably change as I require specific knowledge.
Pytest and the intro Data Engineering topics are really interesting.
