> If last week wasn't good, this was an abysmal week for running. ;(

That was a quote from last week... unfortunately my progress has not improved, rather it has stagnated.
I caught a cold from a colleague who had it for a couple of days, who passed it on to another who started freaking out as her usual concoction was not as effective.
In the current climate I decided to fully rest and recover which meant taking the week off.

The following Monday the president announced the national emergency which sent many into a panic. My work did a trial of working from home for each department. Most of my work is on remote servers so I can do my work anywhere there is an internet connection.

By the end of the week the company has decided to implement a work from home policy until furhter notice. The policy working from home is 8 til 5. My usual time is 7 til 4, which usually leaves me around 90 minutes before before the buzz of the office.  
I decided to keep my schedule, normally up at 5am - i sleep in til 5:30, then go for a run and be home around 7:30. clean up and brekkie, ready to start at 8am. I can then put in 3 hours uninterupted work before standup. I then have another 2.5 hours blocked before I fetch the kids and do the less intense work til 5pm.

Throughout the week, many races have been cancelled. I think UTCT will be cancelled as well due the many international entries. So I have decided to not enter the race (entries are still open) but still continue training for it. I should have the distance down by then, but then I will work on increasing speed and running economy. I wwill then prolly do one or two races to tweak whatever needs improving.

Hopefully from Monday, training continues...
