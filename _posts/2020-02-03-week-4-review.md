This week running has really taken off!
I did my [first MAF test](), and finally completed my first long run.
So, it seems I was off to a slow start, excuse the pun. Running at my aerobic pace was a real challenge on Monday. I didn't have the motivation on Thursday, and as I was leaving work to go run...my wife  reminded me that it was my mom's birthday :facepalm:

Saturday I did the MAF test. I was feeling great, so I decided to do another lap barefoot. It was also the first day of my no sugar and no grain diet to kick start my fat burning system. Sunday morning was my long run and snuck out while everyone was asleep. I enjoyed the cool air and luckily I completed my run before it started heating up. I found it easier to stay in the aerobic zone, but found I started speeding up near the end. It could be because I was not very comfortable on the route towards the bridge - in fact I went above the threshold for a minute going pass some dodgy guys on the bridge. I plan to _not_ take that root home again.

I find it easier concentrating on my heart rate than on my pace. hopefully my max aerobic pace will increase abit so that I can up my distance. I am feeling very comfortable and want to increase my distance. I don't want to up the distance too fast. but realise my goals were abit too modest. The idea was on perfecting my form first.

Following the advice from Primal Endurance, I have to do at least 8 weeks of aerobic running to build up the base, then I can do some strenuous activities. So I have decided to put Tuesday and Saturday gym sessions on hold till I complete the base building. It was a tough decision as starting this year, Vasbyt will be extra tough and dialled in to the eight of us 'core' members. I figured that I chose a tough goal, and therefore have to give it my all at attempting the challenge.

That makes Monday a chill 5km whilst I wait on the girls. Tuesday will be 90 minute run. Wednessday will be rest day. Thursday or Friday will be a 5-6km run and Saturday or Sunday will be my long run
