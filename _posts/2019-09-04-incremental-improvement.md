Sometimes improving one thing can have many knockoff effects. Some are intentional and foreseeable. The unintended consequences have mostly been beneficial, the others ... I'm waiting to see.

A couple of months ago I decided to commit to learning how to touch type.
I had tried many times before but never got very far. I chose [keybr.com](https://www.keybr.com) as it provided nice stats and the lessons were personalised. Another bonus was that my data was freely available and the geek in me thought it would be interesting to explore once I reached [10 hours](soon.tm).

I have a lot of things on my [list to learn](personal techradar) from last year.<br>
Blogging was one stone that could potentially kill many birds. So I focused on getting prepared. Here's the why -> [The reason for yet another blog](soon.tm).<br>
The (lack of) typing speed was definitely a hindrance as it would break my train of thought, disrupting my flow during coding. I noticed that I was using keyboard shortcuts to cut n paste and move around quite impressively. but it was a crutch.
It was a way to avoid syntax errors in my code. <br>
I decided to make touch typing a habit. Every day I would do around ten minutes of lessons/practice. Since then I have improved fully with my overall average typing speed around 40 words per minute (wpm), although lately each session shows an average of 45+ wpm.

I still need improvement, but I can definitely feel the improvement. I am getting my thoughts down, often writing akin to morning pages, which helps me to edit after and not during me putting down my thoughts. Which means that my writing will get better. My over all ability to express myself will improve leading to greater confidence in social situations.

__update__
on 12 September, after a total time of 11:42:28. Practicing around ten minutes a session, I have achieved my initial goal of having an average typing speed of 40 words per minute (with a top speed of 62wpm).
