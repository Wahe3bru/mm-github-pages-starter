So the first week and I am already off schedule :anguished:

I started so lovely, doing a short yoga (for runners) routine followed by a movnat newb drill. I knew that it would only last til the week school starts, so will be incorporating it my evenings until I can manage to get up at 5am successfully - it all depends on my previous nights sleep, as a recovering insomniac sleep is always a priority.

Unfortunately I had a tummy bug and was unable to run for the 2nd half of the week. Luckily my weekly goals are laughably small. The real focus was on form, so I practice my posture throughout the day and working on flexibility in the evenings. Implementing the Chi Running form from the initial small distance makes it easy to improve and make subtle changes when necessary.

The third week is when school will be in full swing and routines will be in place. In February all extra curriculum activities will be active and by then my routines and alternative exercises should be planned.

This all feels theoretical until I take the first run :running:
