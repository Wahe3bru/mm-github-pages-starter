### Nobody:
### Me: 'So a couple people were wondering how I got into programing...'
I started learning python years ago. I had learned Basic, followed by Turbo Pascal (as well as HTML). In varsity I learned the basics of Java. Years later I decided to learn programming again. I chose python because of the simple syntax. after I covered the basics I lost interest and started learning JavaScript as I was following the (old) [FreeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/) curriculum. It took a bit of getting used to the parenthesis but I had experienced it before with Java.
D3 was they main reason for sticking with JS - it was just awesome having full control of the graphics and creating interactive viz.

Once I started playing with my Raspberry pi I switched back to python but this time it was different. I started with the basics but I progressed quite quickly. I started practicing with [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) and even when I got the result I still looked at other solutions and started picking up tips and tricks. I learned how list comprehension works just by comparing my solution with theirs and reverse engineering.
I created a lil (jupyter) notebook to share some insights I gained from viewing others' solutions.

After learning SQL I looked for something similar and came across [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com). There's a discussion section where solutions are discussed which can be quite helpful - as long as you don't cheat!
I mostly hackerrank now to focus on specific areas as they have a nifty 'subdomains option' that lists all problems from that subdomain. Some subdomains I will be focussing on soon will be "Closures and Decorators", "Regex and Parsing" and "Collections" - there are some interesting tools from there that I often come across in stackoverflow answers.
