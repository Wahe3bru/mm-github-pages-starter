### Nobody:
### Me: 'So incase you'
I started learning python years ago. I had learned Basic, followed by Turbo Pascal (as well as HTML). In varsity I learned the basics of Java. Years later I decided to learn programming again. I chose python because of the simple syntax. after I covered the basics I lost interest and started learning JavaScript as I was following the (old) [FreeCodeCamp](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/) curriculum. It took a bit of getting used to the parenthesis but I had experienced it before with Java.
D3 was they main reason for sticking with JS - it was just awesome having full control of the graphics and creating interactive viz.

Once I started playing with my Raspberry pi I switched back to python but this time it was different. I started with the basics but I progressed quite quickly. I started practicing with [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) and even when I got it I still looked at other solutions and started picking up tips and tricks. I learned how list comprehension works just by comparing my solution with theirs and reverse engineering.

After learning SQL I looked for something similar and came across [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com). So now years later ...
