The focus on my first week was on starting to do mobility exercises, strengthening feet exercises and learning the correct posture.
The mobility exercises which include stretching, yoga and foam rolling, should aid in increase range of movement. The strengthening exercises will allow me to run for longer and to transition into barefoot running. Learning the correct posture will allow me to put less strain on my body. This will greatly benefit me in the, ahem, long run.

The Chi Running posture:
step 1: Upper body alignment (like string pulling at the top of the head)
step 2: Lower body alignment (toes facing forward)
step 3: The Verticle Crunch (lower abs to pull pelvic bone) straight waistband
step 4: Connect the dots (column; head, shoulders, hips and feet)
step 5: One-legged Posture stance (practice keeping form while shifting weight from one leg to the other).

This will prolly be a work in progress, but I plan to Chi Walk everywhere so that I drill this posture in muscle memory.
