Sunday: 4.7km<br>
Monday:<br>
Tuesday: <br>
Wednesday: <br>
Thursday: <br>
Friday: <br>
Saturday: 10.2km<br>

So this week has been a challenging week.  
On Monday I had forgotten my shoes, so was unable to run my usual 5km while I wait for the girls.  
Tuesday was so incredibly hot that when I got home I took a nap! I was so exhausted from one of the hottest days of the year.  
Wednesday I was ready to go. I had all my kit but was halted by my wife. My mom was arriving today and I had to help out in preparation ;(  
I am not sure what happened Thursday but as the log shows, no running took place.  
Friday we had supper and games night at a friend so there was not enough time to squeeze in a short run.  
Saturday was the school camp out, but since we were only going after lunch - I had a chance to get some mileage in. I ran 10km and was feeling really good. I got home and made a delicious omelette using my new pan :) Since starting this goal I have really upped the healthy eating plan in my family. Annie has really embraced cooking (and eating) healthy meals.

After listening to "Science of Ultra" podcasts - really wanted to implement a consistent running plan. Running 5 days a week. Hopefully from next week as weekday patterns return to normal I can develop that consistency.


Here's my [Current progress](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H0mhu07J8WtfGKEOs-UWe3nkA82EiA9dPQcAg_J0RnI/edit?usp=sharing)
