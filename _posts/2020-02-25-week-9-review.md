If last week wasn't good, this was an abysmal week for running. ;(

I had packed my bag with my running kit when prepping for school campout, but unfortunately the school gates only open at 8am.
I wasn't that surprised as someone told me the night before that he'd also had that plan but found out about the gate opening time.  
Turns out he was a triathlete and a running coach. He gets up at 4:30am most mornings for a group run. unfortunately as a recovering insomniac I mostly always choose sleep. The more I read about health the more importance is placed on sleep and its benefits.

So anyway after a relaxed packing up I decided to go for a late afternoon run. I really love the route that I take, viewing the different house designs but more importantly the way the trees grow. I do find it fascinating the way the trees interact with each other.

Monday I did my usual 5km route and I finally got into a constant cadence - rarely having to stop. My overall pace was slower than usual but i feel like something clicked.

unfortunately my headaches are making a comeback so I was totally wiped for the rest of the week. Wednesday we had free birthday meals at Spur and maybe it was too much garlic in the sauce but that brought on a severe headache. I double checked the next day with the leftovers - think I was in bed before 9pm. I only fell asleep after 12 though.

This weekend we had two nieces sleepover so that was my Friday and Saturday gone.

I feel like this is maybe "the dip" where motivation becomes less as more obstacles get in the way. I will counter that with atleast attempting a run. 30 minutes is not much and even if I spend it doing laps around the park - i'll count it as a win.  
Wednesday and Thursday seems to be the hardest. So if I can do the long run on Tuesday sandwiched between two short runs I'll be closer to achieving consistently. 

Here's my [Current progress](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H0mhu07J8WtfGKEOs-UWe3nkA82EiA9dPQcAg_J0RnI/edit?usp=sharing)
