## Reboot
I do have a hard time putting my thoughts down. Especially when it is put on display.
That leads me wanting to put out quality work, which adds further planning and editing that results in delays.
I end up with alot of incomplete articles/tutorials that benefits no one.

So I have decided post as often as I can with the requirement being atleast one interesting sentence.
a minimal viable result if you will.
This will get the ball rolling and will eventually lead to more organised thoughts
and better ideas and hopefully up my output which would make it easier to put out better quality posts.
The mere practice of a skill will result in honing skills that I believe will level up other skills.

I will rely on tags to seperate thoughts from data science stuff.

It's a work in progress...
