I have learned a lot this year. It has been a drastic change, but I welcomed.

As the final third of our lap around the sun commences I am trying to complete another 100 days of code challenge.<br>
So why not use it as an opportunity to review the lessons learned and maybe delve deeper into particular topics that i might understand at a higher level.

Here's a list  of topics that I would like to cover:
- [ ] complete list:
- [ ] basics
- ML Models
- - [x] Ensemble of Decision Trees
- - [x] Decision Trees
- - [x] k-Nearest Neighbors
- - [x] Kernelized SVMs
- - [x] Linear Models
- - [ ] Neural Networks (Deep Learning)
- - [ ] Naive Bayes Classifiers
- Strings and formatting
- Pipeline and GridSearchCV
- - k-fold and train, test, split cross validation
- [ ] Metrics
- - [ ] Regression - adj, R^2, MSE, others
- - [ ] Classification - confusion matrix, accuracy report, ROC, AUC
- [x]RegEx
- NLP
- Text Classification
- [x]Command line
- [x] Bash
- Git/Github
