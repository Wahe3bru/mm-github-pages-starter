Like everything I charge head onto... I try to research and gain as much information as possible. You learn alot from mistakes, but I can learn alot more from others mistakes and the lessons they have learned and generously share. I'll still make alot of those same mistakes, but I will be aware and have an idea of where the mistake originates as well as possible corrections. I'd rather fine tune which route is the best (knowingly) going in the right direction.
I can then focus more on deliberate practice.

I also like to juggle a couple of ideas in the air as I concentrate on one or two things. For example yesterday I focused on running at a constant cadence (my natural 170bpm) whilst trying to keep my heart rate between 140 and 150. I failed, averaging 163bpm, but kept my cadence consistent for most of the run. When I slipped up, I noticed it was when my form deteriorated and then made sure I was relaxing my foot and emphasised lifting up my feet whilst keeping the ankle relaxed.

That pace was way too slow and constantly switching from current bpm to the route on my watch also added to lapses in concentration. It should happen less as I familiarise myself with the route, or when I start running for the full hour regardless of distance.

I like having a menu of topics with which to select, though I try to focus on one main objective. I have such limited opportunities that I always have a backup plan b, c, d or e. Otherwise, if all else fails, I have a few moments of being alone with my thoughts.
