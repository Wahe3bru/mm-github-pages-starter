Today is the official start of my preperation for [Ultra Trail Cape Town 65km](https://www.ultratrailcapetown.com/65km).

I have only some idea of the undertaking, like most things, I can research and theorise but only once I am in it can I truly appreciate the effort and adjust accordingly.

I figure ten months should be enough time to prepare. Based on a 10% increase in mileage each week I took a modest start at 5km and should reach 45km by the end of June and 65km by the end of July. You can view my (hopeful) plan [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H0mhu07J8WtfGKEOs-UWe3nkA82EiA9dPQcAg_J0RnI/edit?usp=sharing)

The low initial mileage was chosen so that:
- it's a gentle ease into a habit/routine
- less chance of injury
- so that I can focus on running technique and perfect that early on

Besides the actual running which will only start becoming challenging in March (10+km), there are other distractions that I would like to minimise in the window before that.

I would like to learn the correct and most efficient running form early on, so that the benefits can be compounded (instead of the opposite happening). I know from years of cycling as well as the hours of sedentary office work that I have become very inflexible and increasing my range of motion will help in all aspects of my life.

My current areas of focus are:
- running posture (and posture as a whole)
- flexibility
- increased mobility

Using [Chi Running]() and barefoot running information, I can focus on improving my running form.
A combination of yoga, stretching and foam rolling to increase flexibility.
Combined with [MovNat]() to increase mobility.
I plan on doing some [foot specific exercises](https://www.barefoottrainingcentral.com/barefoot-exercises-to-strengthen-your-feet/) to strengthen my feet watching Netflix or as a fun game with the kids.

My diet will no doubtably be changed and nutrition on the whole will be a big learning experience for me - probably the scariest aspect for me as I have a sensitive tummy, which has a large influence on my chronic headaches. So the lessons learned will not need to be repeated.

Having this as the biggest goal for the year will have a rippling effect on my overall health which will aid in my studies and family life as well - more time alone to think means making the time with family more effective.
