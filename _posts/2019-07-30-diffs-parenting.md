My wife and I have different parenting styles and our interaction with our kids are slightly different.

Yesterday we both spent time with them separately and how we went about it sums up
the difference quite succinctly. There's no good or better, just a difference.

whilst mom relaxed while waiting for lunch to finish, I took the twins on an "adventure".
They took their bikes whilst I ran along as we took a ride/run through the neighborhood to check on my cousins home whilst they are away overseas.
They actually wanted to ride to the park but there was not enough time before lunch.

So later the afternoon Mom took them to the park (by car) and afterwards ice cream.

She prefers to be risk averse, whilst I acknowledging the risks don't let that keep us
from having fun. They are more likely to come home with a scratch or two or a bummed knee - but that has not stopped their enthusiasm in exploring the world around us.
