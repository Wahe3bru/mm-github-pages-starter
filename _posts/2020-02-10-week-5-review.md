Monday:<br>
Tuesday: 8.16km<br>
Wednesday: rest day.<br>
Thursday: jaw problem<br>
Friday: jaw problem<br>
Saturday: run ?km<br>
Sunday: family distraction<br>

This week was not very consistent. Unfortunately I'm not quite sure, I woke up with my jaw muscles absoolutely stiff, like I had spent the night at a rave in 1998 8). With a jaw that felt permanently clench it made my headaches very painful which resulted in me doing the absolute essentials and going to bed.
Some research suggests it could be my positioning of my head during Tuesday's run. more likely it was sharing the bed with the twins and waking up with my head in an awkward position...

As I was about to leave work friday, my wife asked if I could fetch the kids which meant no run.<br>
Saturday morning my run was cut short as I needed to buy a present for the party at ten am. Afterwards we did some house cleaning for the small get-together later that night. But first it was a couples massage :) I liked that they paid alot of attention to my legs especially my left inner thigh which I had ITB problems with last year.

I will probably do more sport massages as the mileage increases.

Though the run count was low, the overall distance has increased and I will be building from here. The initial distance was graciously low in order to allow for routines to settle and quick wins.
