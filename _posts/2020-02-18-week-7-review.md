Tuesday: <br>
Wednesday: 5.2km<br>
Thursday: <br>
Friday: <br>
Saturday: 5.1km and 3.3km<br>

Sunday I took a a different route, going through my old hood. Since I don't listen to music (or podcasts) I am focusing on my cadence and admiring the trees and the gardens in front of peoples homes. There are some that put a great deal of effort in them, but I find most just use a landscaping company. The result is quite bland and unexciting, ho hum...

There are however some beautiful old trees and running through three different areas I can see the transition from old big houses to more modern houses recently build or renovated.

I am enjoying the long run but can foresee my route needing to change as the mileage increases. Before long I will be running to Obs, through Pinelands and eventually through Wynberg to Constantia.

I forgot my shoes on Monday, and arrived at my car to find the battery flat :( by the time I got home I was too tired to run. So Wednessday I made sure to have all the necessay things and doubley sure to turn the car's lights off! I did the Monday route while I waited for the girls. I can feel that I am getting faster and will prolly include the Monday and Wednessday as my slow runs, with tuesday being my long runs - the focus being on doing the distance, and Sunday being on the mountain with Boggles. I might include Saturday as another slow run, but that would depend on availability. This Saturday I ran the long way to my mom to due some pool maintenance while she's away, and took a more direct route home as my tummy was moaning for brekkie.

This week was my longest mileage and there is no soreness so this should be my minimum distance run. 2 * 5km slow run with a max mileage long run as my base. Everything else is gravy and pure enjoyment. Though the Sunday mountain missions would classify as training.

Here's my [Current progress](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H0mhu07J8WtfGKEOs-UWe3nkA82EiA9dPQcAg_J0RnI/edit?usp=sharing)
