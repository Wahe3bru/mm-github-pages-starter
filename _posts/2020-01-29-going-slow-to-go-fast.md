I have been reading [Primal Endurance](#), and have come across Dr Phil Mafatone ([website](#)). In order to increase speed, I have to build up my aerobic base. That means running at a max heart rate that is in my cardio zone. The Calculation is as follows:
```
HR Zone Lower: (Maximum heart rate - Morning Resting Heart Rate) * 0.7+ Morning Resting Heart Rate => (185 - 50) * 0.7 + 50 = 144.5 bpm
Upper: (Maximum heart rate - Morning Resting Heart Rate) * 0.8 + Morning Resting Heart Rate => (185 - 50) * 0.8 + 50 = 158 bpm
```
I had some idea how slow it was, but only realised my actual speed once My watched beeped when I was over the upper limit - which happened all too frequently. It's a constant battle between getting comfortable trying to keep the same pace, and the frustration of having to drop to walking everytime max aerobic zone is reached. I have noticed on the return home, my watch beeps alot more.

I ran passed on an old man on his walk and he was quite amused, commending me on my slow pace.
I don't really care about what others' think. We are all going along on our own journey. I would gladly explain to those interested...but most are not, or prefer sticking to the popular opinion. Fortunately, growing up an only child, I am more open to novel ideas and rarely succumb to societal or peer pressure. Although I have been greatfully influenced by individuals that advice I took to heart.

For the moment, I am working on perfecting my form. The longer I run, the more time I have to correct. Hopefully my base will improve soon so that the walks are minimised.

The biggest sacrifice for me is giving up Vasbyt (and xfit) for the next 8/9 weeks. I have committed fully. Abstaining from sugar and processed carbs for the next 2 weeks. There after limiting my carb intake to 150 grams - how, I will have to solve. Then I can incorporate going hard during vasbyt and limiting xfit to Saturdays only if I am well rested.

The aerobic runs will continue on Monday, Thursday/Friday, and the long run happening on the weekend.
I have been reading on the merits of sprinting, or doing heavy weights and will incorporate that once my aerobic pace plateaus.
