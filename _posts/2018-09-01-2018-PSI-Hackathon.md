I received an email inviting me (as part of a team) to partake in a hackathon. After some encouragement by fellow colleagues who have also never partaken in one, coupled with a lull in the current project (awaiting action from client) I decided to join.

>[Excerpt taken from invitation]<br>
>The Centre for Public Service Innovation (CPSI), on behalf of the Minister for Public Service and Administration, will be
hosting the 12th Annual Public Sector Innovation Conference in August 2018. This
conference, whose main thrust is to entrench innovation in the public sector, takes place
against the backdrop of a South Africa that is on that cusp of growth and renewal that is
inspired by hope.

>On the sidelines of the conference, a Hackathon facilitated by Geekulcha will be hosted
for young techies/innovators to build solutions that would help advance the call: How do
we use Open Data to enable partnership for an Agile and a Renewed Public Sector
through Innovation

>__What:__ A 36 hour Hackathon, no sleep - all night of code and building using OpenSource tools, Data and guidelines set by the CPSI and Open Data South Africa <br>
__When:__ 29 - 30 August 2018; Wed 09:00 - Thur 16:00 <br>
__Where:__ Cape Town International Convention Centre, South Africa <br>
__Who:__ Public innovation enthusiasts, coders/programmers, designers, data scientists <br>

>The participants will build data-centred solutions to help strengthen partnership and
integration in the public centre, gender-based solutions and enhanced service delivery
through smart citizenship.

Our expectations going in was that there would be problem statements with some basic data given. So we arrived eagerly with our laptops, ready take on a challenge.<br>
Unfortunately it was more open ended, with a theme of _"data-centred solutions to help strengthen partnership and integration in the public centre, gender-based solutions and enhanced service delivery through smart citizenship"._

We had a very informative presentation about [afrobarometer](www.afrobarometer.org), who they are, what they do and how one can access the data (and even visualise it) on their site.
Then we were left to hack-athon-and-on, and on...

In trying to find a problem with which to solve we needed data.
We spent a lot of time searching open data portals looking for data that we could use. Our strengths are analyses and modelling, so when we then came across code4SA datasets about crime statistics, we felt that we could provide valuable insights.

#### Our results, an interactive dashboard providing insights about crime statistics:

Here's some explanations on some of the pages on the dashboard:
__page1:__ Our title page, our team decided by a fan of a particular cop comedy show

__page2:__ The map on the left displaying the population density of South Africa. The map on the right displaying the distribution of police stations across the country. The bigger and darker the circle the more crimes reported at that station. The page is fully interactive with year filters and selecting a province zooms in on the police station map.

__page3:__ Displays the trends of number of reported crime in the top 5 police stations over the 12 year period (top graph) and the most common crimes nationally (bottom graph). The crimes to display being selectable.<br> Noticeably The Mitchels Plain police station shows a sharp decline in reported crime in the last year (have some new programmes or improvements been made?)

__page4:__ Displays the Protests data we found. The map of all protests in the country with blue dots being peaceful and red being violent. The donut breaks down the reasons, with the 3 main reasons being Service delivery, Labour related and Crime.

__page5:__ A heatmap of the Sentiment analyses on the reasons for each protest. The darker the brown the more negative the sentiment and the darker the green more subjective. We found this quite cool but realised that it would be abit much for those unfamiliar so we focused on crime, education and environment protests. Environmental protest were all none violent and highly subjective. Crime was mostly negative, and more subjective protests ending in violence - possibly due to frustration as South Africa having extraordinary high crime statistics

__page6:__ Highlighted the prevalence of violence against women world wide, nicely segueing into

__page7:__ Displaying crimes commonly perpetrated on women. The map showing that it's a national problem with no discernible clusters. Using the year filters one can see the progression of reported crimes noting that in 2005 sexual assault and sexual harassment was not specifically counted. It may be due to these categories being created after 2007 and therefore being counted in another statistic.

__page8:__ A Seaborn lmplot from two datasets, namely reported crime at each station, and the population that that each station serves. Obviously the greater the population the more crimes reported. The green dots so show police stations that show exceptionally low crime stats, and the red dots displaying the top ten highest reported crimes with regard to their population, with Pietermaritzberg having 11 times as much reports than the national average.<br>
Surprising as it was not on the top 5 police stations in page 3.

__page9__: Shows a forecast of crimes afflicting women mainly. Given the limited datasets (and time) we acknowledge that this is a very basic model (ARIMA model) and note the features required to build a more accurate model.

There were some clustering that we wanted to try and I found a great dataset about hospital survey data but we decided to rather polish up what we had and work on a cohesive story.<br>
At midnight each team presented what they had verbally and received feedback. Our "product" was mainly visual so a quick summary of what have done and plan to do followed by Skinny of Geekulcha finding more information to assist us, noting that data on gender-based violence is inherently difficult to get.

I am more than happy at what we achieved. Unfortunately we did not make it to the final 3 but it was a great learning experience. I heard some interesting ideas and the passion and creativity was astounding. With more experience and mentoring I have high hopes for our future creatives.

Special mention to [Keenan G](https://twitter.com/iamkeenanG6) who note only won 1st place but had enough enthusiasm for his cause, that he won me over completely.
