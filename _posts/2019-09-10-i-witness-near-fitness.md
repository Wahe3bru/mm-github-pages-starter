I have read multiple times about the link between exercise and memory/learning. Which to be honest was not that hard to comprehend, having seen the benefits of cycling to work everyday. Sleep being the other important factor in memory and learning. So when I studied last year I paid more attention to my sleep - being a recovering insomniac and chronic under-sleeper it was the best bang for buck for enhancing my intense year of learning programming, databases, statistics and machine learning.

I still ran trails on the mountain and cycled to and from the lab (although half my usual distance). I stopped xfit and boxing and focused more on my studies.

I started this year my new role at a company that was abit too far to commute by bicycle.
A couple of months ago I realized I had developed abit of a paunch and for the first time went over 80kg! The final blow came when I got dropped from the group in Tuesday Trails going uphill in the first 20 minutes ;(

I had worked out a route to work which was ~20km (my old route was 12km). The plan was to get fit and start cycling to work when the weather is consistently warm.
I went back to gym and uncle Howie was starting a more intense class based on his previous military experience. I signed up hoping i will level up quicker.
I now do the vasbyt class twice a week, but I no longer run TT as it clashed. After reading [Kevin's summary of Spark by John Ratey](http://www.kevinhabits.com/1-page-cheatsheet-john-rateys-spark)
I have added a bit of Yoga and Tai Chi for balance and flexibility, and will start running around the area for an hour whilst I wait on kids tutelage.

I have the initial schedule, spaced out nicely and sandwiched between daily routine. Now to begin implementation ...

The easiest way to do something is make it a habit, and the only easy way to do that is with consistency. Since vasbyt starts at 6pm and my girls tuition is 6-7pm - which I plan to run, I might as well add the Yoga and Tai Chi at 6pm on Monday and Friday, with Sunday being the day to catchup on any missed sessions.

It seems like alot but I'm already doing vasbyt on Tuesday and Saturday, Wednesday and Thursday I have an hour to kill, and the flexibility and balance requirement is ~30 mins which I can do yoga at home on Monday when Annie's at the gym, and short form (tai chi) either Friday night or Saturday morning while Ruby at gymnastics (which I used to do).
I can do all at 6pm weekdays which means a consistent time, all I need to do have my kit ready the night before and even when willpower is low, I just need to start and that will count as a win. I need to sometimes just jump in an find my way, eventually I will find optimizations in the way I do it or how to go about it. <br>
I tend to geek out like that.<br>
pretty soon I will be tracking and using the data for interesting insights and trendi(ng) graphs ;)
