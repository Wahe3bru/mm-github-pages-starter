Now that school has started and most people are back a work, routines are developing and becoming consistent.
I will develop a more consistent routine around weekly life.

I'm typically up at 5am, get home around 5pm, which leaves us with 40 minutes to changes clothes, get necessary books for muslim school, have a snack and leave. While they are in class, I have an hour which I will run on Monday, and study on Wednesday. We back home at 7pm, in that hour we have supper, homework, washing and bed routine.

Tuesdays are different. I go straight to the military base after work. I warm up a bit and do 'Vasbyt' class around 5:45pm, then there's around 15-20 minutes rest before 24's and xfit class. Since this is the only guaranteed day of exercise I push to my limit and often come home exhausted, barely able to have supper and manage to muster the last of my strength to shower and get into bed.

Thursdays the girls don't have extra class so I intend to walk them to the park and get maybe some easy runs in around the park.

This Saturday there was no xfit class, but we had a wedding to attend the morning and visited some family.

Sunday morning I decided to take my daughter with for the long run (6km). She did well on her bike when I ran to the shop so I decided to take her along for my runs. Unfortunately she got a puncture at 3km and so we had to walk the bike back home :( She really enjoys these mini adventures that only she is able to enjoy with me.

I should be able to fit in 3 days of running per week. As the distance increases I will have to rework Thursdays and maybe include a long run on Friday evening.
