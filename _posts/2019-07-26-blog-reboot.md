My wife and I have different parenting styles and our interaction with our kids are slightly different.

Yesterday we both spent time with them separately and how we went about it sums up
the difference quite succinctly. There's no good or better, just a difference.

whilst mom relaxed while waiting for lunch to finish, I took the twins on an "adventure".
They took their bikes whilst I ran along as we took a ride/run through the neighborhood to check on my
cousins home whilst they are away overseas.
