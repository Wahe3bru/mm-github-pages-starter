excerpt: "Sometimes situations arise that force us to go back to basics."
---
We all grow accustomed to the way have setup our work environments, and the tools we use.
Sometimes situations arise that force us to go back to basics. Being able to know the basics of `bash` will help in being a well rounded data scientist. For example, having to work on a remote server via ssh to troubleshoot and using `head data.csv` only to find out that the data.csv is incorrect. So to notify perhaps the data engineer that your input (his final output) is incorrect and show/give him a sample: `head -n 25 data.csv > sample_current_input.csv` - trivial example, but hopefully you get my point.

Here are some notes i took learning the basics of Bash:
_structure of shell command:_

`CommandName [-arg1name] [arg1value] [-arg2name] [arg2value] filename`

### cat
`cat data.txt` this will print the entire file in the terminal even if the file is too big to open in notepad++

### head and tail
`head data.txt` print 1st ten lines

`tail data.txt` prints the last ten lines

`head -n 3 data.txt` prints 1st 3 lines

### piping "|"
Provides a way to use basic commands in a consecutive manner.
eg `cat data.txt | head`

### wc
shell command that __counts the number of lines(-l), words(-w) or characters(-c) in a given file__

`wc -l data.txt`

### grep
if you want to print lines in your file with a particular word. Regular expression can also be used with grep

eg. `grep "2010|Expense" data.txt | head`

### sort
the options for sort are:
- `-t`: Which delimiter to use?
- `-k`: Which column to sort on?
- `-n`: If you want Numerical Sorting. Dont use this option if you want Lexographical sorting.
- `-r`: If you want to sort Descending. Ascending by Default.

eg. `sort -t ";" -k 5 -r -n data.txt | head -10`

### cut
this command can select certain columns from the data.

options are:
- `-d`: Which delimiter to use?
- `-f`: Which column/columns to cut?

eg. `cut -d ";" -f 1,2,5 data.txt | head`

### uniq
command removes sequential duplicates. used with sort can get distinct values in the data.
for example  to find 10 distinct names in data: `cat data.txt | cut -d ";" -f 2 | sort | uniq | head`

if used with `-c` similar to __count distinct__:
`cat data.txt | cut -d ";" -f 2 | sort | uniq -c | head`

### Other useful Utility Commands
#### Change delimiter in a file
_Find and Replace Magic_: Replace certain characters in file with something else using the tr command.
eg. `cat data.txt | tr '|' ',' | head -4`

#### Sum of a column in a file
`awk`find the sum of a column. Divide it by the number of lines and you can get the mean.
`cat data.txt | awk -f "|" '{sum +=$5} END { printf sum}'`
[further uses for `awk`](http://mlwhiz.com/blog/2015/10/11/shell_basics_for_data_science_2/)
#### Find files in a directory
eg find all .txt files that _start with lowercase h_ `find . -name "h*.txt"`

to find all .txt files _starting with h regardless of case_, use regex `find . -name "[Hh]*.txt"`

#### Pass file list as Argument
if you just use a pipe, any command/utility receives data on STDIN (the standard input stream) as a raw pile of data that it can sort through one line at a time. However some programs don't accept their commands on standard in. For example the rm command(which is used to remove files), touch command(used to create file with a given name) or a certain python script you wrote(which takes command line arguments). They expect it to be spelled out in the arguments to the command.

`find . -name "[hH]*.txt" | rm` won't work

To get around it we can use the `xargs` command which reads the STDIN stream data and converts each line into space separated arguments to the command.

`find . -name "[hH]*.txt" | xargs`

then you can delete files starting with "h", but better to first see the files with `xargs` than to remove blindly

`find . -name "[hH]*.txt" | xargs rm`

another use: used with grep __find all files that contain a certain string__

find . -name "*.txt" | xargs grep 'dear John'

Another use for this can be for __passing arguments to a python script__

#### Output to a new file `>` append to an existing file `>>`
cat data.txt | tr '|' ',' > newdata.txt

note `>` newdata.txt will replace and overwrite if existing file.
