title: "Communicating my commute"
excerpt: "Insights gained from analyzing my Strava commuting data. Exporting my strava data into csv format, I use Pandas for data manipulation, and Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries for visualizations. Grouping the data into different subsets I gain insights into how my commute changed seasonally, what conditions were favourable and other trends."

I started cycling to work
- rehabilitate my knee damaged in an accident
- avoid sitting in traffic and
- get fit and healthy.

When I started cycling to work in 2014, my office was 6km away and I enjoyed (recently created) bicycle paths for most of the way. My office then moved to the CBD which increased my commute distance to just under 12km. By then I had been commuting to work (both office and sites all over the Southern Suburbs) for about 3 years. I started using Strava to record my daily commute in December of 2016.

Quick note:
2017 displays my average work commute for the year. In 2018 I studied At [EDSA](https://explore-datascience.net) which was about 8km from home. In 2019 I started a new job that was located in Tygerberg Office Park, 20km away from home. I have wanted to commute but unfortunately personal safety was a concern from both family and from experienced cyclists. <br>
