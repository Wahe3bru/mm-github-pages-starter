I started cycling to work to a) rehabilitate my knee damaged in an accident, b) avoid sitting in traffic and
c) get fit and healthy. When I started cycling to work, my office was 6km away and I had (recently created) bicycle paths for most of the way. My office then moved to the CBD which was just under 12km. By then I had been commuting to work (both office and sites all over the Southern Suburbs) for about 4 years. I started using Strava to record my daily commute in December of 2016.

Quick note:
2017 displays my average work commute for the year. In 2018 I studied At [EDSA](https://explore-datascience.net) which was about 8km from home. In 2019 I started a new job that was located in Tygerberg Office Park, 20km away from home. I have wanted to commute but unfortunately personal safety was a concern from both family and from experienced cyclists. <br>
