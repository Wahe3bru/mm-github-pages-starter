## So what's currently got my attention?

### Nature
Prepping the (front garden) ground for soil rehabilitation and terraforming via sheet mulching.
Planted a Lime and Mulberry tree, as well as strawberries and some pretty indigenous flowers and Borage - a nutrient accumulator.

### Nurture
I have start monitoring [HRV](https://ouraring.com/heart-rate-variability-basics/).
building a baseline and will be incorporating it into my meditation and physical practice .

I have started reading A Hitchhikers guide to the galaxy for my kids bed time story. If that is not successful I will start on the Harry Potter series.

### Nourishment
I am restarting my sprouting system and planning on growing microgreens.
I just completed Fire and Blood and looking for a sci fi series next.

### Nerding
building a system that webscrapes a local seed shop with variable availability of seedlings. Documenting the availability of each seedling and notifying me when there are new seedlings available.

### Learning
I am currently learning ways to put ML into production.
- Focusing on pytest and writing test, testing code coverage and TDD.
