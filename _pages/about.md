I am a life long learner. The world is a big and interesting place. I find too many things interesting in particular humans, and their interactions.

I had a science focussed background in high school which composed of mainly formulas and algorithms, except for Biology. That was the only subject that I had to right essays. I had to piece systems together to understand the whole. Everything came so easy to me with regards to systems.
When I switched from Computer Engineering to a Psychology and Sociology major - I never shy away from things i have little experience/exposure, I was definitely a fish out of water. I learned so much more from the experience, complimentary to the academic education.

I am creative, creative problem solving is **the only** successful approach in finding solutions to novel problems without mentors.
<br> I am an only child. In a society where the first other only child's I met were at UCT - it's viewed with sympathy but I see it as a definite positive. I can view things with an objectivity
